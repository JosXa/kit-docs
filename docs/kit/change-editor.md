# Change Editor

This will re-prompt you to pick an editor from your PATH by updating your kenv `.env`.

You can always manually change the editor that Script Kit uses to open files in `~/.kenv/.env`.

The following would use `code` (assuming is on the "PATH").

```bash
KIT_EDITOR=code
```

If `code` isn't on your PATH, you can add the full path to the editor.
