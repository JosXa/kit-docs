# Manage Kit Environments

A "kenv" (Kit Environment) is a directory with a `scripts` directory. This is the place to create a kenv to manage scripts for your dev team or projects that expose APIs (GitHub, Vercel, etc). We'll be releasing official Script Kit kenvs in the future to show off some of the best practices. üëç

Clone, create new, link, push, pull, remove. This menu allows you to manage any of the kenvs you've added to your machine.
