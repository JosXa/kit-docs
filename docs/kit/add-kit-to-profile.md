# Add ~/.kit/bin to $PATH

> This is similar to VS Code's "Add `code` to path"

You can run the `kit` CLI from your terminal with

```bash
~/.kit/bin/kit
```

but this option will allow you run the CLI with:

```bash
kit
```

> If you're familiar with adding to your `.zshrc`, just add `~/.kit/bin` to your PATH.

The `kit` CLI will allow you to run, edit, etc scripts from your terminal.
