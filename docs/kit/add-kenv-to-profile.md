# Add ~/.kenv/bin to $PATH

Each time you create a script, Script Kit also generates a command based on the name you can run from the terminal.

If you create a script named `list-downloads`, then Script Kit creates a `~/.kenv/bin/list-downloads` executable.

Then you can run the command like so in the terminal:

```bash
~/.kenv/bin/list-downloads
```

This will walk you through running the command without the full path:

```bash
list-downloads
```
