# Get Featured

Simply share your script to Script Kit's [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/johnlindquist/kit/discussions/categories/share) in the "share" category and it will automatically (after a review period) get added to [scriptkit.com](https://scriptkit.com)

You'll even have a user page based on your GitHub user name: [scriptkit.com/johnlindquist](https://scriptkit.com/johnlindquist)

## Prep a Script for Discussion

With a script selected, hit `cmd+s` (think "s" for "share"). This automatically:

- Creates a gist of your script
- Creates the install link
- Copies the script and link to your clipboard
- Opens the discussions page

So all you have to do is "paste"!
